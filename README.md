### Tuts+ Course: Introduction to HTML
**Instructor: Alex Spencer**

HTML is the language of the World Wide Web. If you want to put any amount of content on the Internet, HTML is the first thing you want to learn. In this course I'm going to teach you the absolute basics of HTML and how to create a website from scratch. I don't assume any prior programming or Internet experience, so this is the ultimate beginners' course.
